Description of method,Experiments which involve running a simple climate model with and without a country’s single GHG emissions to then attribute resulting warming differences to individual countries,A series of algebraic operations which can be performed to identify the direct and indirect environmental byproducts associated with countries’ production processes. This method was used to extract information from datasets prior to its inclusion within the SEFS dashboard,A means of operationalising or applying principles with data to make them more useful within the real world,In-built functions of Python’s Dash and Flask libraries have been used to build the SEFS dashboard by creating features such as drop-down boxes and checklists.
